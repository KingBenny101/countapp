## What are Leaderboards?

Leaderboards allow you to:

- **Compete** with others by sharing counter data
- **Compare** rankings in real-time
- **Motivate** each other to reach goals
- **Track** group progress on shared objectives

Each leaderboard is identified by a unique **6-character code** (letters and numbers) that you share with participants.

## Understanding Leaderboard Codes

### Code Format

- **Length:** Exactly 6 characters
- **Characters:** A-Z (uppercase letters) and 0-9 (numbers only)
- **Examples:** `FITNES`, `WATER1`, `STEP2K`, `ABC123`

### Code Behavior

**When you enter a code:**

- **Code exists:** You join the existing leaderboard with other participants
- **Code is new:** You create a new leaderboard and become the first participant

!!! note "Case Insensitive"
    Codes are automatically converted to uppercase. `abc123` and `ABC123` are the same leaderboard.

## Attaching Counters to Leaderboards

### What Gets Shared?

When you attach a counter to a leaderboard, the following data is shared:

- Counter name
- Current value
- Counter type (Tap Counter or Series Counter)
- Last update timestamp

### Selecting the Right Counter

You can attach any counter you've created:

- **Tap Counters:** Compare total counts (e.g., daily steps, water glasses)
- **Series Counters:** Compare latest values (e.g., current weight, daily revenue)

!!! warning "Privacy Note"
    Only the current value and counter name are shared. Historical data and detailed statistics remain private on your device.

### Updating Your Counter

Your leaderboard ranking updates automatically when you update the attached counter:

2. The leaderboard will reflect your new value on next sync

### Deleting a Leaderboard

### Privacy Considerations

Remember:

- Anyone with the code can join your leaderboard
- Your counter value and name are visible to all participants
- Choose counter names that don't reveal sensitive information
- Use generic names like "Daily Goal" instead of specific details
